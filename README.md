# 🦆 DuckFi — Decentralized Analytics Infrastructure

> **DeCloud Your Analytics.**  
> Run, share, and reward local-first analytical workloads powered by DuckDB-Wasm.

DuckFi is an open-source initiative that brings database analytics to the edge.  
Instead of sending data to the cloud, users run queries locally in their browsers or devices using DuckDB-Wasm and connect through a peer-to-peer mesh network to collaborate securely.  
Contributors who share compute or datasets earn **DuckFi Coin (DFC)**.

## ✨ Core Features
- **Local-First OLAP:** analytical SQL engine embedded in browser or edge runtime.  
- **Privacy-Preserving:** no central data warehouse, data never leaves your device.  
- **P2P Query Mesh:** cooperative query execution via libp2p/WebRTC.  
- **Tokenized Incentives:** earn DFC for compute or verified connectors.  
- **Open Governance:** protocol evolution decided by the community DAO.
